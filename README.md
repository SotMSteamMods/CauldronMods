# CauldronMods

**What is the Cauldron?**

The Cauldron is a custom fan expansion for the [Sentinels of the Multiverse](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/)
cooperative card game by Greater Than Games.  These decks were designed by Matthew Bishop (@Tosx), his roommate, and his brother.
The base set was begun around 2013, and the last set was completed in 2019.

This project will bring the fantastic Cauldron Decks to [Sentinels of the Multiverse Digital](https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/) as a Steam Workshop Mod.
The mod team is dedicated to delivering as close to a professional game experience as possible.

**How to I play this mod?**

You can!

Handelabra is implementing Mod support now so Workshop integration, art and many more features are still to come.
