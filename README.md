# CauldronMods

**What is the Cauldron?**

The Cauldron is a custom fan expansion for the [Sentinels of the Multiverse](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/)
cooperative card game by Greater Than Games.  These decks were designed by Matthew Bishop (@Tosx), his roommate, and his brother.
The base set was begun around 2013, and the last set was completed in 2019.

This project will bring the fantastic Cauldron Decks to [Sentinels of the Multiverse Digital](https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/) as a Steam Workshop Mod.

**How to I play this mod?**

You can!
The 3.1.3 version of Sentinels released Nov. 19th supports ad-hoc loading of mods for alpha test.
Join the Discord above for instructions and downloads.

Handelabra is implementing Mod support now so Workshop integration, art and many more features are still to come.
You can follow the development on [Handelabra's Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/handelabra)
channel with [Weekly Dev. Streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGPBmjNUB43ick6QwxGIOMFFN5yKuTvQU).

We are working to implement the core Cauldron decks so that they are ready to play out of the gate
