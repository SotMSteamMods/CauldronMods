# CauldronMods

**What is the Cauldron?**

The Cauldron is a custom fan expansion for the [Sentinels of the Multiverse](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/)
cooperative card game by Greater Than Games.  These decks were designed by Matthew Bishop (@Tosx), his roommate, and his brother.
The base set was begun around 2013, and the last set was completed in 2019.

This project will bring the fantastic Cauldron Decks to [Sentinels of the Multiverse Digital](https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/) as a Steam Workshop Mod.

**How to I play this mod?**

You can't.
Handelabra is implementing Mod support now.
You can follow the development on [Handelabra's Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/handelabra)
channel with [Weekly Dev. Streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGPBmjNUB43ick6QwxGIOMFFN5yKuTvQU).

We are working to implement the core Cauldron decks so that they are ready to play out of the gate
when mods are available.
