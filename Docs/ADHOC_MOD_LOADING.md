For ad-hoc loading, create a folder named "mods" alongside your Sentinels app/executable.

Inside that folder, each mod must be in its own folder (example: mods/SampleMod).

Each mod must have a file named manifest.json. This file specifies all of the information the game needs to load the mod.
This can be located in the Docs folder as well.
