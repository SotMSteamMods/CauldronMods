Amelia Espada was a drifter, doing odd jobs and getting into scrapes, until the Halcyon Security Corporation identified a latent mutation in her genome and had her abducted off the streets of Guadalajara.

She awoke in an underground lab. Years of experiments and memory wipes followed. The scientists sought to awaken and weaponize her mutation, which allowed her to extrude a liquid metal sheath from her pores, forming it into spines or armor. Her body also healed at an accelerated rate to survive the trauma of projecting and retracting the sheath. She had become the 19th and most promising subject of the top-secret Halberd project.

After 3 years, she was nameless and savage. After 5, her healing ability had grown so effective that her broken mind began to repair itself, and she plotted her escape. She cut her way out of her cell, destroyed the bulk of the lab, and freed the other test subjects before collapsing. There she was found by Mark Savage, an old soldier investigating Halcyon's illegal activities. He led her to the surface as the facility exploded around them.

She took the name Quicksilver in place of the name she had lost, and began to hunt down the remnants of the Halberd project and its parent company. It didn't take long for her to discover that Halcyon considered her an investment it was not ready to part with.
