As Drift became more adept at manipulating time, she experimented with moving herself through it. The results were erratic: her attempt to rescue her friends, stuck in the far future, instead sent Drift to an alternate version of the year 2199. 

While recovering her strength she encountered another extradimensional visitor: Outlander, an evil version of her ancestor Sir George, who was also traversing realities. He almost killed Drift, but before his sword fell, she shifted farther than ever before, winding up as an older version of herself in her home reality's 1929. 

She resolved to gather allies across both timelines, using the experiences of her own past and future selves, to defeat the evil knight.
