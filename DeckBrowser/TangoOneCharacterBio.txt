By the time she was 15, Julia Takahashi spoke 6 languages. She also harbored low-level psionic abilities, which she kept to herself. As an adult, she put these talents to use as an unnaturally skilled interpreter. That job lasted less than a year before she was recruited by Eclipse, a shadowy mercenary group which ran the best black ops agents money could buy. As it turned out, they only recruited those who were psionically gifted.

Julia was given the operational callsign Tango One. While each job strained her rather flexible morals, Eclipse was mostly hired to go after corrupt officials, mad scientists, and the like. It didn't bother her that someone else stood to gain when they took out the trash. Plus, the equipment and training they provided were top notch.

One day the boss unveiled Eclipse's newest operative: a shapeshifting parasite bonded to a psychotic volunteer, able to kill and replace government officials, leaders, even superheroes. Eclipse was really a training ground for agents of invasion. Their boss was an alien in disguise, and it used the operatives' psychic sensitivity to enslave their minds.

But Julia was stronger than it expected and broke free. Her partner sacrificed himself to buy her an opening, and she used it to put a bullet through the alien's oversized brain. Then she fled the ruins of her former life, knowing that pieces of it might well return to haunt her. The shapeshifter was still out there. The invaders might still be coming. She would be prepared.
