Tom Willow was an unexceptional man from Hartford, Connecticut. The most exceptional thing about him was his death: a sorceress seared his heart with a runic curse, draining his life force to fuel her magic.

The second-most exceptional thing about Tom was where he died: a witchwood full of ancient power. The mark that stole his life was burned into the tree behind him, along with the last fragment of Tom's soul.

Over the next decade, that tree slowly shaped itself into Tom's form, patterning its rudimentary consciousness after his remaining memories. It believed it was Tom Willow. It found that the mark over its heart allowed it to channel runic magic.

It went forth to into the world to determine what kind of man Tom Willow had been, and what kind of man he would be. The year was 1927.
