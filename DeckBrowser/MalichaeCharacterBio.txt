Alec Shaheen knew that this world was not the only one. His long fascination with the ancient ruins of the Dasht-e Jenn desert uncovered stories of powerful spirits, separated from Earth by a great veil. Ignoring the mockery of his colleagues, Shaheen abandoned his doctoral studies to scour the desert for a hint as to how this veil could be pierced. To survive he became a guide and cartographer; it was not long before one of his clients, a shadowy businesswoman, revealed that she believed his theories and wanted to fund a more thorough expedition. Shaheen did not question his fortune. He organized everything, and, after a year of rigorous searching, located the fabled Compass of Zephaeren; reportedly the key to crossing the veil.

As soon as Shaheen had identified the Compass, the group's escort of tribesmen turned on them, slaughtering the other researchers. Shaheen only escaped by activating the Compass. In the strange realm where he found himself, he impressed and befriended a fearsome djinn named Bathiel. Days later Shaheen returned through the veil, bringing his new ally with him, and defeated the surprised tribesmen that were still hunting for him.

With Bathiel's help and guidance, Shaheen took the name of Zephaeren's legendary student, Malichae, and began tracking down the earthly locations of other djinn and learning to call on their aid. He knew he would need as much help as could get - someone had already killed for the Compass's secrets, and would surely try again.
