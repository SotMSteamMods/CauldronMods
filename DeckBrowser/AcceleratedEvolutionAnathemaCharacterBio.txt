The Eclipse, the mercenary group which had created Anathema, was destroyed by one of its own operatives shortly after the shapeshifter's birth. Anathema escaped into the world without ever learning the purpose behind his creation, but he didn't particularly care. 

As the bond between host and parasite grew stronger, so did Anathema's powers - and his psychosis. Subtlety was not his way; he could shapeshift into almost perfect replicas of his targets, but he was more prone to increasingly grotesque transformations, bearing less and less resemblance to his once-human form.
