Following his break with the military, Havoc traveled throughout South America, trying to get back to basics: making injured people whole again. It lacked a bit in excitement, but that didn't last long. 

His old C.O. kept close tabs on the world; whenever she saw a situation developing that could benefit from Havoc's touch, some pay phone nearby would ring. Like the vagrants being abducted in Guadalajara; that had turned into a right mess. By the time his C.O. got around to forming her own private rescue team, Havoc was already back in the habit of saying "yes ma'am."
