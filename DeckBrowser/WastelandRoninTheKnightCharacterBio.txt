A paradoxical visit to his past self via unstabilized time travel had caused Sir George's relationship with the 'present' to begin breaking down. When he re-encountered his future descendant, Alain Mormont, the resulting timeline glitch flung them both into the thousand-year-future of the Final Wasteland. 

Fleeing the hordes of roaming monsters, the pair stumbled upon the dormant wreck of the mysterious timeship, the F.S.C. Continuance Wanderer. They scavenged armor and weapons from the ship, and searched vainly for a way to reactivate it. Recalling Jim Brooks' stories of an ancient library where humanity's knowledge might have survived, they set out across the wasteland to find it.
