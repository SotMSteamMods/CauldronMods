Vanish's Translocation Accelerator, originally designed by a clever intern at the Eaken-Rubendall Laboratory, extended her teleportation range greatly. With heroics having become a full-time occupation, Vanish found herself constantly pushing the limits of the device, despite the fact that it had occasionally left her stranded in uncharted dimensions. 

But that was just the tip of the iceberg. An overload during battle caused the device to send Vanish and her teammates not through space, but through time itself. Now Vanish was stranded in the year 1929, before the technology to fix her Accelerator even existed.
