Esther Martin had retired from an illustrious career of life-saving heroics well before most of the world's current saviors were crawling. But Martin's idea of retirement was no more conventional than the rest of her life; the former military Search and Rescue pilot became the commander and electronic warfare specialist of an international peacekeeping task force for the next decade. When political bickering began to sour that experience, she became a private security consultant, teaching hand-to-hand combat to soldiers and civilians from around the world.

While that work paid the bills (exceedingly well), Martin slowly, almost deliberately, faded from the international spotlight as she entered her third retirement. A lifetime of making contacts, trading favors, and hoarding knowledge left her with eyes and ears across the globe, and a very long reach for helping to solve problems.

In secret, Martin constructed an underground base on the southern coast of Australia, filled with state of the art surveillance gear and a hangar for her custom-built rescue aircraft, the "Kestrel". From there she began operating as an information broker, ensuring the right people were in the right place at the right time, even if those people had no idea who was responsible.

Over the years, the mysterious, all-knowing voice on the airwaves gained a nickname: Echelon.
