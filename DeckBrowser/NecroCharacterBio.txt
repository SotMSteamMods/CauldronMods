Simon Coil was fascinated by death - particularly by the idea that it might not be the end. Working as a mortician in Rouen, he spent his nights experimenting with necromantic rituals or visiting occult groups. He had no friends among the living save a nephew, whom he treated like a son. The boy's untimely death drove him from theory to practice; in his grief, he employed spells from an ancient tome to bring the boy back to life. But the undead thing he had created bore no semblance of his nephew, and Coil was forced to destroy it.

That might have been the end, had Coil not learned that his nephew's death was no accident - a crazed cultist from Coil's younger days was responsible. Coil opened the tome once more, raising the corpses of three criminals from the local morgue, and used them to power his magic rituals. He wrought his vengeance upon the cultist, but it was not enough. His research into the dark powers expanded, as he sought more tools with which to scourge the wicked.

The culmination of his research was the discovery of the corpse of an ancient dragon, buried along the coast of France. Once he overcame his disbelief that such a thing existed, he determined to raise it as the ultimate undead power source. But the dragon's own regenerative magic permeated its bones, and instead of a mindless zombie, the creature returned fully to life, raining destruction down around Coil. Too late, he realized what his recklessness had cost, and swore to make it right.
