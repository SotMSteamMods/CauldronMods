In Windmill City, there existed a little-known urban legend: that a giant, terrifying reptile haunted the sewers. Even Gunner, a homeless ex-soldier who'd fought his share of inhuman monsters, found the stories far-fetched. He'd often sheltered in the city's underground, without any sign of such a creature. So he was most surprised the day he met Athena.

For her part, the clumsy but amiable Rapturian was excited to make her first human friend. Her earliest memories were a hazy jumble: the destruction of her homeworld as a child, and the scattered exodus of Rapturian survivors. She remembered her parents sending her in an escape pod to Earth, where she had lived in hiding for almost a decade. She had chosen her own name out of her favorite book, a tome of mythology found among the refuse.

Athena impressed Gunner with her mechanical knowledge, showing him the Rapturian racing shell she had designed from discarded tech and dim memories. In turn he shared news of the wider world, familiarizing her with the planet that she now thought of as home. She especially loved stories of the city's heroes, such as the vigilante known as the Cricket.

Soon Athena realized she had no desire to stay hidden underground. From the sound of it, there was plenty of evil afoot. She wanted to join the ranks of the heroes who would thwart it. With a hearty wave to Gunner, she headed for the surface.
