Though most still found him and his powers disturbing, the man referred to as Necro had proven to be a valuable ally against the dark forces of the world. His experiments with summoning and sacrificing the undead continued, albeit more cautiously after the incident with Tiamat.

He would do whatever it took to hold back the darkness.
