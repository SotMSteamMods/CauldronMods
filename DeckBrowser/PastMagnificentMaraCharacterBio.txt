When a group of heroes disappeared in a teleportation accident, Mara volunteered to help search for them. She sought the help of Faye Diamond, an expert in occult objects. With Faye's help, Mara uncovered new secrets about her relics, eventually opening a time portal in her kalpak. 

It disturbed her, knowing the old hat she'd casually worn in her last stage performance had such power. But what disturbed her more was Faye's proclamation that Mara had a special connection to such objects of power - not just her four, but other relics as well. A connection that might be useful to find her friends in the past. The tricky part would be finding a way back.
