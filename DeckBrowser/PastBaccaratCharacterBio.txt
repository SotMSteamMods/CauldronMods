Deckard was almost 50 years old in 1929, but his appearance hadn't changed for the past 19 years. Ever since he had won his bet with Fate, life had been good. Occasionally, he even let his altruistic side get the better of him; on those nights he would take to the streets as a vigilante, protecting citizens from the mob by slinging his magical cards with perfect and deadly accuracy. 

When he heard rumors of other supernatural do-gooders appearing in neighboring cities, it only inspired him further. Unfortunately for Deckard, his luck finally ran out soon after, and he fled to China wishing he'd had the chance to meet those strange heroes.
