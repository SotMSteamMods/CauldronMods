Alain Mormont was brought up on fantastic stories of her heroic ancestor, a knight who had defended Britain from evil dragons. According to the stories, her whole family was descended from the knight's daughter - a daughter he had never known about; born while he was away and raised to follow in his footsteps after he disappeared. 

Alain loved the idea, and found it more than a little believable. Her mother was a fencing instructor. Her grandfather, a famous smith. Alain learned all she could about medieval weapons and armor, training with her grandfather's heirlooms. 

Then the news reported that a real dragon had attacked Paris, and a knight had appeared to fight it off...and Alain knew this was what she had been waiting for.
