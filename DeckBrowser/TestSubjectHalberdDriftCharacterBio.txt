Helping others to learn about their past was something Drift excelled at, given her abilities. But before she could peer into the past, she had to first visit that location in the present. While assisting Quicksilver with research into the now-destroyed Halberd facility, she visited its ruins and accidentally activated the dormant Halcyon R47 AI. 

Crazed and unaware of current events, it assumed Drift to be its newest test subject, and proceeded to trap her in a maze of chambers designed to categorize her abilities. In the end, it was a rather exhilarating and challenging experience, and Drift left the AI intact with no hard feelings.
