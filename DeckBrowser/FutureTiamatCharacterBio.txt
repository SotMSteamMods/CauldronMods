In at least one reality, the cult of the Forgotten Order survived into the 22nd century. After countless failed attempts at instigating doomsday by summoning demons or ancient gods, they decided to try a more direct approach: they would build their own dark messenger, to cleanse the world through destruction. 

The cult's agents had already infiltrated advanced scientific and military installations around the planet. In secret, they smuggled the necessary technology to a disused cistern beneath Highwind City, and assembled a cybernetic incarnation of the long-dead dragon Tiamat. Once unleashed, it would do what its living ancestor had failed to do: bring an end to humanity.
