Kate Shreeve's early months as the vigilante Cricket were a constant learning process. When she wasn't interfering in the affairs of violent criminals, she was sneaking into UWC's science department after hours to upgrade her costume and equipment. 

She had several close calls that were only averted thanks to advice from a strange voice, broadcasting at extremely low frequencies and seemingly directed at her. Eventually, Cricket tracked it to its source and met Echelon, an information broker who kept an eye on Earth's superhumans and was looking to form a specialized emergency response team.
