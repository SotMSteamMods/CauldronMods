As he located and destroyed the Halcyon labs which were still trying to weaponize his nanotech, Karl Schrader learned that he was not the only party interested in Halcyon's illegal activities. The information broker known as Echelon had been keeping a weather eye on the company, and had in fact been instrumental in arranging for the recovery of Schrader's body on the night of his accident. 

Meeting in person, Schrader soon became a full member of Echelon's international emergency response team, building and upgrading the team's equipment with his nanites.
