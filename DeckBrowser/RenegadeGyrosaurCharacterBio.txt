One of Gyrosaur's first misadventures after reaching the surface was an encounter with the Renegades. Believing, like many, that Cricket's little band were criminals, Gyrosaur initially tried to apprehend them, but her heart was not in it, and the Rapturian soon found herself conversing with the group.
