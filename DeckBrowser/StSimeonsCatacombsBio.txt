For a thousand years, the fabled catacombs of St. Simeon's collected the bones of princes and paupers, knights and criminals. The twisting passages and massive vaults served many masters and purposes: they were variously employed as dungeons, warehouses, and torture chambers. The remains of evil sorcerers and witches were sealed within the catacombs, in hopes that its hallowed walls would keep them firmly in the next life.

Soon after being used to seal away such evil, St. Simeon's was abandoned and all record of its location destroyed, suggesting that perhaps its walls were not as effective as advertised.

Now rediscovered with the aid of the Knight, the seal on the catacombs has been broken, and its occupants await their new guests.
