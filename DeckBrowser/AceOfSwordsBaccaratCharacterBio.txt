The Fate deck's most dangerous weapons were the cards of the suit of Swords. Capable of conjuring blades of pure magic, or serving as explosive projectiles, Deckard relied on them heavily whenever direct confrontation was called for. 

His century of experience and mystical knowledge brought many heroes and organizations seeking his help, and Deckard found comfort in always having such potent weapons close to hand.
