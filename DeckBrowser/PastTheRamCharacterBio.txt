Catchwater Harbor, 1929. Admiral Samuel Winters was overseeing a secret amphibious weapons program in the manufacturing district. On the brink of being canceled due to years of failed tests, Winters had resorted to corporate espionage, theft, and whatever other means he could think of - anything to get an edge and a working prototype. 

One morning, Winters' most trusted agent brought him the impossible: a glowing disk-shaped device with electronics so advanced they seemed to be from the future. That evening, Winters filed a string of fabricated progress reports to keep his superiors distracted, while secretly shuffling his best scientists to a hidden factory. He was convinced that the device, and its power source, were the keys to building the weapon he desired. And if was half as powerful as he hoped, he saw no reason to share it with the government.
