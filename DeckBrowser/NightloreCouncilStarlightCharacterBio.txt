Working as a grad student with Dr. McLear's astronomy team, Erin Rothes finally felt like she had found a family. McLear could be a bit distant (and prone to strange disappearances), but she was steadfast in encouraging her protege's scientific curiosity. When McLear went missing at the same time as "Starlight", one of Earth's mysterious guardians, Erin figured things out fast and knew there must be trouble. She delved into her boss's notes, piecing together her extraplanetary activities, deciphering the location of the Council's sanctum, and even finding McLear's backup Nightlore tech. 

The Council was understandably surprised when Erin warped into their midst, but they were quick to corroborate her fears that McLear had been captured. Erin was teamed up with Vydani'thiel, a coarse law enforcement officer from the binary Asheron system, and the patient Chik Grak Seen from frigid Cryos-4; together, the three newest Nightlore agents were given the urgent mission of locating and rescuing Dr. Andromeda McLear.
