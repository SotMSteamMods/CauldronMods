After years of evading the Halberd project's agents, Quicksilver thought she had largely destroyed the group. As it turned out, the overarching Halcyon Security Corporation had simply cut their losses and moved on, constructing a new, even more elaborate supersoldier testing program from the ashes. 

Known as the Harbinger project, it employed the now-cyborg Reager for test subject retrieval, and using a piloted R-44 exosuit he finally recaptured Quicksilver. She was the only Halberd survivor to have fully resisted their chemical control compounds, and they were intent on learning why. Quicksilver had her own plans: Reager was closer than ever before, and she was still determined to interrogate him.
