Janet Walker grew up wanting to be an explorer. Some mornings she inexplicably awoke in the middle of the wilderness, miles from her home in Huntsville, Ontario, but she took these events in stride. As an adult she spent her time traveling between consulting jobs, always on the move. 

One contract took her to Windmill City to work on an experimental nuclear reactor belonging to the Gray Pharmaceutical Corporation; while there an accidental reactor fire threatened the entire facility and trapped several employees within the inferno. Janet climbed through the burning debris to find them, and just as the building collapsed, somehow teleported the entire group to safety.

She escaped the subsequent media frenzy and set out to learn more about her strange ability. Bringing her electrical engineering expertise to bear, and consulting some of the greatest scientific minds in the hemisphere, she created devices to help guide her teleportation and harness the extra-dimensional energy that each jump unleashed. Janet's consulting company soon took on a different nature; "Vanishing Courier Service" was there for anyone who needed help.
