Dr. Salim Chandra was renowned for his breakthroughs in gravitational theory, and wealthy from his work as Garotech International's head of research. Less well-known was his wayward son Jai, who tried to aim as far away from his father's careful, measured approach to life as possible. Jai found success as an extreme athlete, performing ever more daring stunts funded by corporate sponsors. He was an underground sensation until his worried father brought his influence and money to bear to end Jai's nascent career.

Jai stormed into his father's lab for a family shouting match just as the supercriminal Phase broke in to steal the elder Chandra's work: the Geograv Locus. The ensuing chaos resulted in the machine's destruction, causing a destabilized gravitational anomaly to begin tearing the city apart. Jai, standing next to the device as it fractured, awoke to find half the city of Akelabad was now floating high above the ground, and he could now bend gravity with his mind. Jai used his new powers to get as many as he could to safety, but his father succumbed to injuries sustained in the explosion. The thief escaped, and Akelabad never recovered.

Jai had lost his closest family and his best chance of understanding his new powers. He thought about disappearing back to his old life, but now it seemed hollow. His experiences had thrown into sharp relief the two courses of action that still held meaning for him.

He would try to help others, to get them to safety when everything was falling apart, and he would hunt down superpowered criminals to prevent such catastrophes from happening in the future.
