Spring: centuries pass. Saplings sprout, and a forest grows deep in the mountains of Eastern Europe. In a clearing at its center, a spirit takes form, born of nature and magic.

Summer: centuries pass. The forest spreads, and its guardian spirit delights in the world and its endless curiosities. She dances with the four winds. She peers from the trees into small towns, wondering at the quirks of humanity. She overhears their stories of strange places and creatures and gods.

Fall: centuries pass. She has become a part of the stories and defeated dark gods. But the forests are waning; she retreats deeper into the recesses of the mountains, away from humanity's encroaching reach. She keeps counsel with the winds and the seasons. Now and then a lost soul stumbles upon her clearing, and if they listen she speaks to them.

Winter: centuries pass. The world grows darker and colder. Even at the heart of the forest, whispers creep in of new powers awakening. The lost souls no longer listen when she speaks. But one day, a man returns to the clearing; a knight who has weathered almost as many centuries as she has. He has been looking for her - for something unchanging. She answers his questions about the past and he answers hers about the present. And as he tells her of the world, she resolves to see it, and become a part of it, and protect more than just her forest.
