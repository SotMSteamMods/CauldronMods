The F.I.L.T.E.R. Space Corps does not exist. This caused some confusion when their timeship wound up in our reality.

Materializing without warning in the middle of the Sahara desert, it took months of study before F.I.L.T.E.R even realized that the enormous crystal was a ship at all. The supporting structure that encircled it was filled with empty causeways and blinking panels, but nothing resembling a propulsion system or control room.

In fact, "ship" was a generous term. The crystal served as a container for a pocket dimension, which could be shifted through time and space to intersect with any reality in the multiverse.

The potential power it offered was limitless. The problem was, no one knew how to control it.
