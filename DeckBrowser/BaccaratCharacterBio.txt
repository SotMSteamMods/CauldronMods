It was Earl Deckard's belief that the universe rewarded the deserving. As a professional gambler he saw plenty of evidence that it favored him; he never lost at games of chance. But there were some things he couldn't win at the table: time, and youth, were slowly slipping away. So Deckard sought out the Mistress of Fate herself, and played for the ultimate stakes. His lifelong luck held, and he walked away with everlasting youth, as well as the Mistress' own mystical Fate deck.

Deckard thought he had won, but though he no longer aged he only had one lifetime's worth of luck, and 20 years later it ran out. Too late, he learned that his life was now forfeit to the Mistress. He fled his home in Louisiana, hiding in the far corners of the world, but to no avail. Fate soon found him.

In his final moments, Deckard convinced her to play for one last prize: a second chance. Then, for the first and last time in his life, he cheated to win. He returned from death, wearing a strange and demonic form. The Mistress was furious at losing her catch.

Since then, Deckard has wandered the world, trying to thwart Fate's machinations and rebalance the scales of his own life in preparation for his next, and final, trip beyond it.
