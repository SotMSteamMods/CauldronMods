As Gargoyle, Marcus Adze kept his past a closely-guarded secret. Occasionally, with some reluctance, he worked with others in the fight for justice, but he never took off his mask. One misadventure, involving an attempt to deactivate a dangerous time machine, left Gargoyle and 4 other heroes marooned in the distant future. 

Even then, as they fought together to find a way back, he kept mostly to himself. But the glimpse of camaraderie did begin to reawaken his memories of his old life - before the world left him for dead; before revenge became his only mission.
