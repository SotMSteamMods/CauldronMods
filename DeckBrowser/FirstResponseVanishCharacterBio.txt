After several years of helping those in need, Vanish's "courier" company was destroyed by the Gray Pharmaceutical Corporation's lawyers, alleging that Janet's abilities were to blame for the Windmill City meltdown. 

In the aftermath, Vanish was approached by Esther Martin, an information broker and retired pilot. Martin said she was forming an international rescue team to respond to "unusual" incidents around the planet. Vanish immediately joined as the group's evac specialist; none too soon, as the team's fateful first mission turned out to be another nuclear incident in Windmill City.
