The deck of Fate was a powerful magical artifact, whose cards could manipulate energy and probability. During his initial encounter with the Mistress of Fate, Deckard stole the deck, employing it as a tool and weapon. 

The suit of Sorrows was particularly effective for trickery and illusion; Deckard could send its cards flying about with his mind or link them with other suits for complicated spells. His use of Sorrows cards, and the subtle tactics they allowed, increased greatly after Deckard lost most of his right arm during a botched expedition to the frozen wastes of Northspar.
