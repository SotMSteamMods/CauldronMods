For many years Sir George of Mormoth faithfully served King Edward III as the commander of his elite guard. His charge was to safeguard King and country from otherworldly enemies. He fought witches and demons. When a three-headed dragon ravaged the countryside, he drove it to the coast of France and cut off its heads. He was dispatched to the Crusades, and traveled the dark forests of Eastern Europe, learning secrets from the ancient spirits there.

When Sir George returned to England, he was met with ruin. In his absence, an evil wizard had killed his wife and enthralled King Edward. The furious knight defeated the wizard and freed the king; but as the wizard was being locked away he cursed Sir George into eternal slumber. The wisest men in the kingdom were unable to break the curse; in the end, Sir George's body was interred in a vault beneath the Palace of Westminster, honored but eventually forgotten.

Six hundred years later, he opened his eyes. A group of oddly-dressed people explained something about a curse and a dragon, and seemed to want his help. The knight was practiced at dealing with strangeness. He entered the new world with his head held high, ready to safeguard King and country once more.
