After several near-death experiences on the Oblask Crater expedition, Janet decided that a more temperate vacation was in order. She arranged to tour several archaeological sites across South America with her friend Dr. McLear, and went by herself when McLear was called away on "urgent business". 

Janet's own vacation was ruined when the first temple she visited turned out to house several recently-discovered magical artifacts, with the villainous Jade racing against agents of the Forgotten Order to steal them. Thoroughly disgruntled, Janet decided that as long as she was there, she might as well steal the artifacts first.
