When an intergalactic zoo-ship landed on Earth in search of unique specimens, it provided an irresistible feast for Swarm Eater. The man-shaped nanoswarm attacked the ship and consumed many of its prisoners, absorbing the abilities of each. 

One of its victims was a mutant and former thirteenth test subject of the Halberd weapons project. Halberd-13's ability to manipulate and control insects through a psychic hivemind allowed his consciousness to take control of the nanoswarm, even as his body was devoured. This new Swarm Eater has lost its overriding hunger, but gained unparalleled control over dispersed nanotechnology.
