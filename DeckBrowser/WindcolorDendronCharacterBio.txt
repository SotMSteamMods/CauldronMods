Dendron's living tattoos drew their strength from the magical energy of the forests, or, occasionally, the life force of Dendron's hapless victims. After many fierce battles with the Stranger and his allies, the ink's power proved finite, and it pooled lifelessly upon the ground. 

Dendron was imprisoned, seemingly powerless, but the skills of a misspent youth soon enabled her escape. She sought a new source of power, and found it when an ancient death god awakened near the city of Akelabad. Drawing upon the storm of magic that was released, she animated every drop of ink across several city blocks, calling it to her, feeling her strength grow even greater than before.
