Born and raised in New York City, Mark Savage joined the army at 18. Partly because he felt it was his duty to serve; partly because he was trying to set an example for his brother Luke, 8 years his junior and already getting into trouble. Partly because it was cheaper than med school, which had been his real dream.

Savage quickly made it through special forces training and was certified as a combat medic. He was hand-picked to join a new international task force, specializing in bioterrorism threats and led by an Australian officer named Esther Martin. Savage saw scattered combat on 5 continents, earning the moniker "Havoc", and continuing his medical education throughout his distinguished career.

Things started to get worse after his CO was forced to retire. Havoc suspected the brass were more interested in obtaining supervillain tech than saving civilians. Meanwhile his brother's life was taking ever darker turns. Havoc finally convinced Luke to clean up his act and join the task force, hoping to keep an eye on him. Sadly, their first and only mission together went horribly wrong; Luke disobeyed Havoc's orders and wound up comatose from exposure to the biological superweapon they were supposed to destroy.

Unable to help his brother or find satisfactory answers as to what had gone wrong, Havoc quit the task force, deciding that from then on he would help people on his own terms.
