Already weakened after battle with the radioactive villain Gray, the Lady of the Wood sacrificed the last of her strength to restore the blasted landscape around Windmill City. As new life took root from the ashes, the Lady's form crumbled into dust.

Havoc found that she had reformed herself in the heart of the clearing. Now reawakened, the Lady's curiosity and determination are fiercer than ever.
