Alain Mormont grew up in a perpetual hurry. There never seemed to be enough hours in the day to do everything she wanted to do: training with her mother, studying history with her grandfather, school, travel, following in her ancestor's footsteps and becoming a heroic knight...

Eventually, Alain and Sir George of Mormoth found themselves in the desolate future of the Final Wasteland, staring at the wreckage of a crystalline timeship. Alain managed to reawaken the controls and impose her will on the strange vessel, sending them home to their own time. Or, in Alain's case, at least something close to it.

In the days that followed their return, Alain began having visions of things that had happened in her her current location minutes or hours prior. More worrying, some of the visions showed glimpses into the future. As Alain began to panic, she glanced down at her hand and saw the flickering outline of the wasteland sword she had wielded in the far future; moments later it was replaced by the outline of the ancestral blade she had held yesterday.

Focusing on the image caused it to coalesce into a glowing copy of the real weapon, heavy and reassuring in her grip. With it came a certainty that she was now something different, something new. She had a feeling that having enough time wasn't going to be a problem any more.
