Gargoyle worked hard to ensure that he remained but a shadow - a terrifying story to frighten criminals and supervillains, his reputation known more widely than his mask. Still, not everyone found his legend intimidating. 

He eventually learned that a Japanese action show had been created using his likeness, where the Dragon Ranger Gargoyle and his Tiamat mecha battled all manner of over-the-top foes. Of course, the real Gargoyle would never admit to finding the show entertaining, or owning any of its merchandise.
