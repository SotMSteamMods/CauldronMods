Pyre's experiences in the blasted Wasteland, along with his admiration for - and eventual friendship with - an ancient nature spirit he had once fought against, had a sobering effect on his outlook. He had no desire to see the planet turned lifeless and barren, a fate he knew he could visit on it if he stumbled. Slowly, he became more willing to accept help, and to give it. 

He also began prioritizing exploration, both for the thrill and to ensure his adventures kept him away from the bulk of humanity, so that any missteps would be less dire. At least, that was the idea. The mechanical beasts of Oblask Crater soon made it clear that in their domain, Pyre and his companions would be the ones to bear the consequences of any missteps.
