In the barren reaches of space, the Meer'ago stumbled upon a tiny artificial star, orbited by the ruins of a gleaming citadel. Only one explorer was brave enough to enter. Within, she found bizarre technology and the greatest cache of aethium crystals the universe had ever seen, powering warp gates that allowed access to millions of planets.

Recognizing the opportunity at hand, the explorer began recruiting representatives, one from each world, to form the Nightlore Council. Together they would chart - and guard - the stars.
