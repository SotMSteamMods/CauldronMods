The young Dr. Karl Schrader awoke in a hospital to find he was missing an eye and three limbs. As he began piecing together what had happened, he was surprised to find his body doing the same - in a matter of days, it had rebuilt itself completely.

Before the accident, Schrader had been a rising star in the field of nanorobotics, working to repair and improve the human body. The Halcyon Security Corporation recruited him with the promise of unlimited funding, which kept Schrader's initial questions at bay, but he began to stumble across evidence that his employer had less altruistic plans for his nanoswarm. His further investigation uncovered highly illegal superhuman experiments. Before Schrader could alert the authorities, his boss locked him in his lab and released the incomplete nanoswarm, which devoured most of Schrader's body. He was left for dead.

Now, alive and rebuilt, Schrader is determined to learn the limits of his newly augmented body, and track down the rest of the nanoswarm before it can be used for evil.
