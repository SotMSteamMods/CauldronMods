From humble beginnings, Marcus Adze built success. A brilliant mechanical engineer by his late teens, he started the design firm ARA with his two closest friends. The company took off, soon growing so large that the founders handed control over to a board of directors in order to remain focused on technical work. Adze was their star, an unparalleled inventor on track to revolutionize the energy industry.

Eventually, however, Adze learned that the directors had sold out to Halcyon Security, a secretive private military company. Further investigation revealed that Halcyon had been adapting his tech into advanced weaponry and conducting illegal experimentation with it on captured superhumans. Adze took his findings to the directors, threatening to reassert control over the company if they didn't extricate themselves from Halcyon.

He had underestimated Halcyon's stake in his work. That night, they sent teams of assassins to kill him and the other founders. The world thought Adze and his friends had died in tragic accidents, and Halcyon quietly completed the assimilation of ARA's tech for their own uses.

Unbeknownst to them, Adze survived. He remained hidden from the world, observing how Halcyon avoided any repercussions for their attack. They were not the only twisted company using ill-gotten technology to enforce their will, thinking themselves untouchable because they had power.

Even as a presumed corpse, Adze, had plenty of money and gear stashed away. He decided to remain dead, and focus solely on a new project. He would destroy the weapons that Halcyon had stolen from ARA. He would strike fear into them, their soldiers, and every other corrupt organization out there. He would take back the power they had stolen from him.
