Jai Chandra had left his old life behind thoroughly enough that there was nothing and no one to protect by hiding his identity, but he occasionally worked with other heroes who did, like the Cricket. He didn't learn her real name until she was framed and arrested, and her mentor contacted Impact to arrange a jailbreak. 

Learning about the Cricket's other life, he understood why she wanted to wear a mask, to keep that part of herself alive and safe. So he disguised himself, and set out to help her reclaim it, if possible.
