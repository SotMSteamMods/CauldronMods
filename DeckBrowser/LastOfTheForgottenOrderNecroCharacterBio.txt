Time travel was imprecise. Chaotic. Thus, Necro did not blame his companions when he was accidentally left in the past. He made the best of it, staying out of the history books, while using the newfound power of the lost pages of the Book of the Dead to help where he could. 

Too late, he realized the rituals were corrupting his mind. He lost himself to the dark voices, able to see only the pain and suffering of humanity. In his despair he founded the Forgotten Order; in the decades that followed, he and his lackeys would be among the worst foes his former allies would face. 

But somewhere in his mind, the old Simon Coil still existed. Eventually, the time traveler Drift uncovered the full details of his past, allowing the hero Terminus to purge the evil from his spirit. Now, Necro has set out to destroy the last remnants of his old cult, hoping to finally earn rest...and possibly forgiveness.
