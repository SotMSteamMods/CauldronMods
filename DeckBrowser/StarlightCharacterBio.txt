After earning her Ph.D. in astrophysics at 26, Andromeda McLear spent the next 5 years buried in laboratories, universities, and control rooms, probing the sky to learn its secrets. The universe was too distant for her liking; exploration was too infeasible. She developed theories on stable space-time curvatures, looking for ways to bring the stars closer. All the while, as she spent her nights staring into the abyss of space, she had the feeling it was staring back. It turned out she was right.

Alone in the bowels of the Arecibo Observatory one night, working late as usual, her solace was interrupted by the appearance of a swirling portal, and a voice invited her through. On the other side was an alien space station - the sanctum of the Nightlore Council, a group of intergalactic explorers and peacekeepers. They had been watching her, they said. They wanted to make her an offer: to become the first human representative of the Council, charged to protect the Earth as it came to wider intergalactic attention.

McLear accepted without a second thought. She was furnished with powerful technology, whose origin even the eldest Council agents did not know, and trained to use it. She returned to Earth, burning with newfound purpose. Finally the stars were within reach.
