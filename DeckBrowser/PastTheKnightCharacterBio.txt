Sir George had long since accustomed himself to the future he now called home. Still, when he was sucked into the past along with Vanish and their allies, he felt a brief moment of hope that they might have returned to his own time. 

As soon as he found that this was not the case, he got back to the business of defending the realm. He did not understand his allies' complaints; as far as he was concerned this time period was almost identical to the one they had left. His only concession was to try a little harder to 'blend in' than he had before.
