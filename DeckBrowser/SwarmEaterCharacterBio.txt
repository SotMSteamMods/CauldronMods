Unlike most urban myths, this one began with a string of unrelated people and objects across Europe developing strange powers. Several superhuman watchdog agencies investigated the incidents and found little, beyond indications that an experimental nanoswarm was to blame. Public awareness was limited to the few "augmented" individuals who used their powers to commit crimes.

But soon, rumors began to surface: a boogey man, stalking the night, eating its victims alive. Targeting those who had been augmented. Their powers could not save them. As each one fell, the Swarm Eater reportedly absorbed those powers into itself, like missing pieces of a puzzle.

And according to the stories, its hunger has shown no sign of abating.
