Founded by childhood friends Lars Helberg and Courtney Lace, Screamachine's divisive career ended abruptly during their first world tour, when their show at Windmill City's Radio Plaza was crashed, quite literally, by the giant alien turtle Gyrosaur. She was attempting to help various other heroes stave off an attack on the city from the intergalactic poacher Menagerie, and, unbeknownst to the band, had just saved their fans from an attack drone.

As far as the musicians were concerned, the "heroes" were responsible for the loss of their concert and the other damage to the city. As they picked themselves up from the ruined stage, covered in glowing alien fuel leaking from the drone, they discovered its energies had given them amazing abilities. Valentine could control the thoughts of others with his voice; Slice could shape sound waves into blades of light; Bloodlace could directly manipulate bioenergy; and Ricky G could control the earth itself.

Together they decided that it was time to take things to the next level: they would rid the world of pretentious, destructive do-gooders, AND sound amazing while doing so.
