No maps of Blackwood Forest exist, but there are plenty of stories. Stories of the endless miles beneath its trees. Of the people who left its single well-worn path and were never seen again. Of the black hound with blood-red ears that can find a heartbeat anywhere in the wood. Of cobwebs the size of tents, and shadows that walk, and trees covered in eldritch symbols.

Drawn by these stories, believers and skeptics alike come to the town of Blackwood, almost deserted on the forest's edge, to find out the truth.

They may not like the answer.
