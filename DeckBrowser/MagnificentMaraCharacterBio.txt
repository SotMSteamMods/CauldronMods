Marika Prochazka and her family came to America as refugees fleeing the violence that frequently erupted when you lived near Baron Blade's homeland. As a young immigrant girl trying to learn the language of her new country at school, she was drawn to the art of illusion. Marika learned to do tricks that amused her classmates, allowing her to make friends and tell stories without relying on her broken English.

At 16 Marika started working as a magician's assistant, but she grew tired of that role and at the age of 18, she set off on her own to be a magician. It did not go well. She could pull off big, amazing tricks, but none of that mattered because she couldn't hold the audience. She flopped in Vegas, she flopped in Atlantic City, she flopped in Florida and even flopped in Cleveland.

At 21 the Magnificent Mara was performing on a cruise ship that stopped in China. While exploring the streets of old Shanghai looking for props, costumes or inspiration, Marika entered an old shop. In the window display was a beautiful wand. The young girl inside was helpful and a relentless seller, and when Mara left the shop she had the wand - as well as a weird (and rather ugly) hat, a crystal on a chain and a bizarre pendant.

She soon found that these four items were not just interesting props, but items of immense magical power, and the Magnificent Mara gave up performing illusions and started using real magic to help others.
