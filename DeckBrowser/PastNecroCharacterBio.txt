Necro was among the team of heroes that Vanish accidentally stranded in 1929. He decided that as long as he was stuck there, he might as well get a first-hand history lesson. He tracked down the Book of the Dead, the tome which would teach him necromancy 50 years in the future. 

Opening the book gave him a shock; this past version contained pages he had never seen before, with spells for controlling the mindless zombies after they were summoned. Necro began using his undead minions as soldiers, rather than as fuel for his rituals, wondering all the while...what event would eventually destroy those pages from the Book?
