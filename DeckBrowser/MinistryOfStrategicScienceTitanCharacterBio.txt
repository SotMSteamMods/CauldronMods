Even before joining the Ministry, Roland White had an appreciation for the weird and the abnormal, along with an almost worrying inability to feel fear. Now that he could transform into a nigh-indestructible behemoth, his willingness to saunter into the unknown was coupled with a propensity for solo missions. 

Few of his strictly-human teammates were as casual about their safety. To keep up with him, the Ministry began looking to expand its roster of "talents", hoping that eventually Titan could lead an entire team of specialized agents.
