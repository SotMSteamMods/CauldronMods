One of the more mundane ramifications of becoming Starlight of Earth was being approached by representatives from Area-51, an ill-funded and barely-secret agency of the U.S. government tasked with monitoring alien beings. While many more notable and better-equipped organizations existed doing this exact same thing, somehow Area-51 continued to exist, and they saw Starlight as a useful operative who might restore their legitimacy. 

She almost declined, but it turned out that, somehow, the agency had several useful reports concerning the mysterious invaders known as Eclipse. Starlight agreed to a largely ceremonial role, which afforded her a snappy suit and some memory-scanning tech Area-51 was developing to identify those mind-controlled by Eclipse.
