Born in a previous age, the serpent Tiamat was the last of the great Mesopotamian dragons, plaguing the city of Babylon for decades. Eventually she was driven into the desert, disappearing from history for almost a thousand years, only to resurface periodically and terrorize the developing kingdoms of Europe. With the passing centuries, Tiamat grew ever more powerful; each of her three heads channeled its own elemental magic, and together they sowed destruction and chaos across the land.

By the fourteenth century Tiamat was the last of her evil kind. An English knight finally bested the dragon on the coast of France, leaving her decapitated form to be buried in the ruins of her lair. Dragons faded from the history books.

Until 700 years later, when a misguided spell accidentally resurrected Tiamat in modern Paris. The great dragon let out a roar and resumed her ancient work. Tanks and missiles proved useless against her. Destruction and chaos would reign once more.
