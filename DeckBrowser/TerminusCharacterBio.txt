Officer Tang Daiyu had made a career out of dealing with violent criminal organizations. Unfortunately, her police unit was rife with corruption, and her early idealism was soon replaced by a bitter resignation to bribes and underhanded dealings, as her fellow officers played the various gangs against each other based on who was willing to pay. Until the day when the assassination order came down.

Rumors had been swirling of supernatural elements infiltrating one of the harbor gangs, and for some reason her superiors wanted her to kill the source, a low-level thief with a family at home. Tang couldn't stomach the thought, and something snapped inside her, biting back against the years of shame and injustice she had partaken in. She crept to the docks, intent on warning the target and finding the truth behind the hit, but somehow they knew. She walked into a trap, and a bullet. Her former brethren left her to die, setting the whole dockyard alight to hide the deed. Bleeding and burned, Tang crawled from the rubble. Despite the flames, she felt cold and blackness overtaking her, and was sure that this was the end. She wondered what came next.

When she opened her eyes, she was aboard the Full Moon Express, the ghostly train charged with ferrying departed souls. Disbelief quickly gave way to regret - she wasn't ready. As if her thoughts had been aloud, the train's conductor approached and asked if she would rather have vengeance. "Yes," she replied.

A bargain was struck: Tang received a commission from the conductor and a measure of his powers. In return, she would walk the earth, retrieving the violent ghosts who had escaped or failed to board the train. Vengeance, the conductor had said. But to Tang, it was something more. A second chance. She would not waste this one.
