The inhospitable Northspar landmass, locked deep within the Arctic ice sheet, lay undiscovered until 1994. Its inaccessibility, extreme weather patterns, and strange electromagnetic phenomena stymied every attempt at human exploration of the region; even satellites could not reveal its interior.

Almost 20 years after its discovery, a highly-trained and well-equipped scientific expedition was launched to chart the area. They transmitted normally during the first three days of their journey; after that, they were never heard from again.

Instead of finding answers, the lost expedition has only raised more questions: what is hiding within the borders of Northspar?
