A skilled but lazy technician at the University of Windmill City, Bryce Bauer felt severely underpaid and underappreciated. Besides, his boss was a jerk. So he felt no qualms about helping himself to valuable bits of tech from the lab - things he could pawn for some extra personal funding.

As his job satisfaction decreased, he began planning for a more permanent career change. One of the labs had designed a mostly-working energy converter, and with a bit of after-hours ingenuity and some borrowed parts, Bauer got the rig working. With a little juice, it would be a formidable weapon.

The test run was a success, although it left the University's power substation and several other labs in flames. Bauer's first crime spree began in earnest later that night and lasted several months, until a costumed vigilante got the better of him.

But prison wasn't so bad. Soon several other supercriminals joined forces with Bauer, and together they turned their grudge against "The Cricket" into a plan for escape, revenge, and - most importantly - profit.
