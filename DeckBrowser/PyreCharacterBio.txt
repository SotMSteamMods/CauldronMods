If the CEO of Gray Pharmaceutical had ever had a conscience, he'd worked hard to suppress it. Business was ruthless, and so was he. Things became easier, in a sense, after he was exposed to an experimental reactor and became a walking font of nuclear energy; as his body deteriorated, so did his mind, leaving no room for concerns like morality. There was only survival.

But neither Gray nor his company's scientists, sworn to secrecy, could stabilize his new form, and his eventual meltdown almost leveled Windmill City. The release of energy temporarily cleared his mind. Gray realized that, where once he'd had the world at his fingertips, his current trajectory would only destroy himself and everything around him. As the cycle began again and he felt his mind slipping, Gray knew he could not stop himself. So, for the first time in his life, he swallowed his pride, seeking out those who'd been most successful in stopping him before: the hero known as Vanish and the First Response team.

The team warily accepted Gray's surrender and began working to cure him. Their resident scientist designed a fission regulator, based on experimental Garotech research, but its effectiveness was limited. Sitting in a shielded containment cell and growing more unstable and impatient, Gray eventually came to his own solution: he would embrace both aspects of himself. The corrupt past, and the slightly-less-selfish present.

He broke out of containment, taking the regulator back to Gray Pharmaceutical's lab and integrating it with their imperfect early designs. The resulting high-tech suit was finally able to keep him stable and sane. Gray rejoined Vanish's team and began working to rectify some of his past mistakes, taking an alias to hide from the public. Still, an abundance of mistrust remained - had he truly reformed? Or was he simply biding his time until he could find a more permanent solution that no one could take from him?
