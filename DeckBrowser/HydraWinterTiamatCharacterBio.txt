Tiamat's powerful magic made permanent victory over the dragon elusive. Each time the heroes of this age laid her low, her form regenerated. Sometimes it took days, sometimes a year, but eventually she would return to lay siege to some new city. More worrying still, observers noted small changes to her aspect over time. 

While her initial thousand years of life had altered her little, these new circumstances were forcing Tiamat to adapt at a startling pace. Eventually, in combat with Echelon's team in the ruins of Akelabad, the dragon's three severed heads regenerated into six. Commanding new elemental magic and more ferocity than ever before, Hydra Tiamat may finally prove to be unstoppable.
