In mastering the art of summoning his four djinn companions, Malichae grew closer to them and their world. He found his appetite for the bustle of humanity had ebbed, preferring the ancient mysteries beyond the veil - the stories of great wars that Bathiel had fought in, or the ethereal cities Somael had defended. 

Malichae returned to the ruins of Zephaeren's tomb, spending his time in secret there, studying the scrolls left by those before him. But his isolation could not last. Though he had prevented the evil djinn Oriphel from crossing to Earth, many of Oriphel's followers were still wandering the desert, looking for him and his companions.
