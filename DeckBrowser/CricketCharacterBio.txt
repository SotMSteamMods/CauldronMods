Kate Shreeve kept the world at a comfortable distance, separated from the noise of Windmill City by her headphones. She enjoyed observing other people, but she had little interest in getting involved in their lives. After high school Kate followed in her parents' footsteps, enrolling at the University of Windmill City, even interning in their acoustics lab there.

Barely a week into her first semester, a mysterious explosion destroyed the lab and killed her parents. Kate survived, despite being trapped in the test chamber while it was active. In the aftermath, as Kate moved in with relatives and attempted to rebuild her life, she found that the experiment had given her amazing abilities. She had gained the ability to visualize and even manipulate acoustic energy in the air around her, as well as heightened strength and reflexes.

Kate decided she could no longer keep the world at arm's length - not when her powers might protect others from the tragedy she had experienced. Taking a job as a freelance journalist, both to help pay her bills and as an excuse to go where she was needed, "The Cricket" became Windmill City's newest protector.
