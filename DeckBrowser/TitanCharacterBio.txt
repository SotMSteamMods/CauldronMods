The special projects team of the British SAS was somewhat perplexed when ordered to escort a dusty, bookish man into the bowels of an abandoned London cathedral. Less so when the cathedral turned out to be full of apocalyptic cultists. Most were quickly dealt with, but to the horror of their academic charge, the last cultist had opened a fiery portal, through which monstrous, flaming figures began to materialize.

Spotting a floating chunk of obsidian in the center of the ritual chamber, SAS Trooper Roland White stepped forward and calmly smashed it. This had the desired effect of causing the portal (and cult leader) to disappear. Less desired was White's later transformation into a burning obsidian creature, caused by shards of the material which lodged in his arm.

White was quickly recruited by the bookish man into Britain's Ministry of Strategic Science, a paranormal defence force White had never heard of. Now the demonic-looking White functions as their premier "talented" field agent, keeping the world safe from all manner of strangeness.
